A Firefox Recommended Extension!\n\nAbout TinEye\n\nTinEye is a reverse image search engine that allows you to search by image. TinEye uses image identification technology, not keywords: when you upload an image to TinEye, TinEye creates a unique and compact digital signature or 'fingerprint' for it, then compares this fingerprint to every other image in the TinEye index to find matches. TinEye does not typically find similar images; it finds exact matches including those that have been cropped, edited or resized. If you have never used TinEye, check out our tutorial.\n\nTinEye is perfect for:\n\n    Image verification: find out if a news photo is really what it claims to be, or if that dating profile is a scammer using someone else’s headshot\n    Image attribution: track the original source and ownership of an image\n    Image licensing: see if an image is available from stock image websites to be licensed\n\n\nUsing TinEye is private. We don’t track your searches, keep your images or add them to the TinEye index. The only data we collect is the version of the extension that you’re using. For more information, please see our privacy policy.\n\nTinEye Terms and Conditions\n\nHow to use this extension\n\nTo use the extension, right-click on any web image and select Search image on TinEye from the context menu.

The Facebook Container extension for Firefox helps you take control and isolate your web activity from Facebook.","fullDescription":"What does it do?\nFacebook Container works by isolating your Facebook identity into a separate container that makes it harder for Facebook to track your visits to other websites with third-party cookies.\n\nHow does it work?\nInstalling this extension closes your Facebook tabs, deletes your Facebook cookies, and logs you out of Facebook.\nThe next time you navigate to Facebook it will load in a new blue colored browser tab (the “Container”).\nYou can log in and use Facebook normally when in the Facebook Container. If you click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.\nClicking Facebook Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Facebook Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Facebook about the website that you shared from.\n\nWhich website features will not function?\nBecause you will be logged into Facebook only in the Container, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook Container will not work. This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity.\n\nIn addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Facebook credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Facebook use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.\n\nWhat does Facebook Container NOT protect against?\nIt is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Facebook from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Facebook still will have access to everything that you do while you are on facebook.com, including your Facebook comments, photo uploads, likes, any data you share with Facebook connected apps, etc.\n\nRather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Facebook tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Facebook activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Facebook settings, use Private Browsing, enable Tracking Protection, block third-party cookies, and/or use Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension to further limit tracking.\n\nWhat data does Mozilla receive from this extension?\nMozilla does not collect data from your use of the Facebook Container extension. We do receive the number of times the extension is installed or removed. Learn more\n\nOther Containers\nFacebook Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built in to Firefox. When you enable Facebook Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping, and Banking while you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, you’ll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension. Learn more about Containers on our support site.\n\nKnown Issues\nWhen Facebook is open and you navigate to another website using the same tab (by entering an address, doing a search, or clicking a bookmark), the new website will be loaded outside of the Container and you will not be able to navigate back to Facebook using the back button in the browser.\n\nNOTE: If you are a Multi-Account Containers user who has already assigned Facebook to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Facebook Container. If you would like this additional protection, first unassign facebook.com in the Multi-Account Container extension, and then install this extension.\n\nWhat version of Firefox do I need for this?\nThis extension works with Firefox 57 and higher on Desktop. Note that it does not work on other browsers and it does not work on Firefox for mobile.\n\nIf you believe you are using Firefox 57+, but the install page is telling you that you are not on a supported browser, you can try installing by selecting or copying and pasting this link. (This may be occurring because you have set a preference or installed an extension that causes your browser to obscure its user agent for privacy or other reasons.)\n\nHow does this compare to the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension?\nFacebook Container specifically isolates Facebook and works automatically. Firefox Multi-Account Containers is a more general extension that allows you to create containers and determine which sites open in each container.\n\nYou can use Multi-Account Containers to create a container for Facebook and assign facebook.com to it. Multi-Account Containers will then make sure to only open facebook.com in the Facebook Container. However, unlike Facebook Container, Multi-Account Containers doesn’t prevent you from opening non-Facebook sites in your Facebook Container. So users of Multi-Account Containers need to take a bit extra care to make sure they leave the Facebook Container when navigating to other sites. In addition, Facebook Container assigns some Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and Messenger to the Facebook Container. With Multi-Account Containers, you will have to assign these in addition to facebook.com.\n\nFacebook Container also deletes Facebook cookies from your other containers on install and when you restart the browser, to clean up any potential Facebook trackers. Multi-Account Containers does not do that for you.\n\nReport Issues\nIf you come across any issues with this extension, please let us know by filing an issue here.

With the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, you can...\n\n    Sign in to two different accounts on the same site (for example, you could sign in to work email and home email in two different Container tabs.\n    Keep different kinds of browsing far away from each other (for example, you might use one Container tab for managing your Checking Account and a different Container tab for searching for new songs by your favorite band)\n    Avoid leaving social-network footprints all over the web (for example, you could use a Container tab for signing in to a social network, and use a different tab for visiting online news sites, keeping your social identity separate from tracking scripts on news sites)\n    Protect your browsing activity in individual Containers using Mozilla VPN, so you can shop while travelling abroad but check your bank account from a server in your home country.\n\n\nAfter installing the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, click the Containers icon to edit your Containers. Change their colors, names, and icons. Long-click the new tab button to open a new Container tab.\n\nFor more information on how to use Multi-Account Containers, visit our help articles:\n\n\nAll about Multi Account Containers\nMulti Container user - how to use Mozilla VPN\nVPN subscriber - how to use Multi Account Containers","weeklyDownloads":9212,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Mozilla Firefox","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/4757633/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266157.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266157.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266158.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266158.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266160.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266160.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266159.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266159.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6255,"reviewCount":2729,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/reviews/","updateDate":1643641395000},{"id":"@react-devtools","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/649/649896-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/649/649896-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/649/649896-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"React Developer Tools","version":"4.23.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3899222/react_developer_tools-4.23.0-fx.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/facebook/react","supportURL":null,"description":"React Developer Tools is a tool that allows you to inspect a React tree, including the component hierarchy, props, state, and more.

It's just an awesome extension for blocking ads across the internet, including on YouTube™...yes, that means you can say goodbye to video ads forever!\n\nNOT WORKING?\nPlease use the feedback button to alert me if YouTube™ is not being displayed properly. YouTube™ occasionally updates its styling which may break DF Tube. I also recently ported this to Firefox from Chrome so let me know if there are issues on FF.\n\nREGARDING PRIVACY\nI do not read, examine or track your browser history or any other personal information. The only permissions I ask for are \"tabs\" to insert the functionality and \"storage\" to store your settings. I am a strong believer in privacy. This extension is just a tool to help remove the distracting elements from YouTube™.\n\nThe permissions used by this extensions are 1) Storage - to store your preferences, 2) Tabs - to load the DF YouTube script on each YouTube™ tab you open, 3) Notifications - probably for compatibility with the Chrome version, and 4) https://api.mailgun.net/* domain - which is a service I use to send your feedback to my email.\n\n***\n\nYouTube is directly incentivized to create as many views and ad clicks as possible. As a result we are inundated with tasty thumbnails and advertisements from every angle. While this is good for someone looking to kill time, it's not so good for those of us intending to focus on educational content, do research, or simply find some relaxing music to groove to.\n\nAfter using DF YouTube for a few days, you realize the extent to which the pattern of click, watch, scan mindlessly for a new video, click, watch, and repeat, has been ingrained in us by YouTube's design. DF YouTube breaks that cycle.\n\nBy default, DF YouTube hides the video recommendations sidebar as well as the related videos that appear at the end of videos. It also removes the grid of recommended videos that appear on your homepage. These settings are all configurable. It can also hide comments and disable playlists sitewide.\n\nI hope DF YouTube allows you to focus on the content *you* want to focus on. Give it a try and be sure to report any suggestions or bugs!\n\n***UPDATES*** (11/18/2019)\n- Fixed issue where feed shows for a moment before being hidden","weeklyDownloads":277,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"RickyV","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/14130355/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/204/204591.png?modified=1622133455","width":1273,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/204/204591.jpg?modified=1622133455","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":335,"caption":"DF YouTube hides distracting elements and clickbait including sidebar recommendations, end-of-video recommendations, and more."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/204/204592.png?modified=1622133458","width":1920,"height":1080,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/204/204592.jpg?modified=1622133458","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":300,"caption":"You can hide your feed, as well as the subscriptions bar on the left."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/204/204593.png?modified=1622133467","width":1920,"height":1039,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/204/204593.jpg?modified=1622133467","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":288,"caption":"It's easy to configure DF YouTube to hide only what you want to.
